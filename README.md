## Hi, I’m David 👋

Computer Science student. I build practical projects while strengthening fundamentals in web development and machine learning.

### Current focus
- Front-end: modern HTML/CSS/JS (accessibility, responsive layout, clean UI)
- ML systems: federated learning robustness experiments (anomaly detection + exclusion, robust aggregators)

### Featured work
- **Federated Learning Robustness (PID-style anomaly detection + exclusion)**  
  Controlled experiments across IID vs non-IID, % malicious clients, and attack intensity. Benchmarked against FedAvg and robust aggregators (e.g., Multi-Krum / TrimmedMean / Bulyan / RFA). Logged robustness vs cost (accuracy/loss, detection metrics, runtime per round).
- **Web practice + mini-projects**  
  Small focused builds to improve layout, UI structure, and JavaScript fundamentals.

### Tech
`Python` `PyTorch` `Flower (FL)` `Git/GitHub` `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `[add: SQL / Rails / etc if you want]`

### What I’m open to
- Collaboration on beginner-friendly front-end projects
- Research-style coding help (reproducible experiments, clean logging/plots)
