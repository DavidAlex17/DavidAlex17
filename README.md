## Hi, I’m David 👋

Computer Science student. I build practical projects while strengthening fundamentals in web development and machine learning.

### Current focus
- Front-end: modern HTML/CSS/JS
- ML systems: federated learning robustness experiments

### Featured work
- **Federated Learning Robustness (PID-style anomaly detection + exclusion)**  
  Controlled experiments across IID vs non-IID, % malicious clients, and attack intensity. Benchmarked against FedAvg and robust aggregators. Logged robustness vs cost.
- **Web practice + mini-projects**  
  Small focused builds to improve layout, UI structure, and JavaScript fundamentals.

### Tech
`Python` `PyTorch` `Flower (FL)` `Git/GitHub` `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`

### What I’m open to
- Collaboration on beginner-friendly front-end projects
- Research-style coding help
